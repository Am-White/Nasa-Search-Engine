# NASA Image Search Engine

This application generates images and information based on the users search entry.

---

## Description

NASA Image Search Engine is a responsive web app that displays images and information about space, stars and planets. The user enters a desired word and when the search button is pressed results appear using two NASA API's and one Wikipedia API. A picture of the day will also appear in a side card, whatever picture is shown was taken on the same date as today (with the exception of the year).

Users can then hover over their result images and click one of the heart buttons to add it to a list of favorite images. This is connected to local storage and will be saved even if the user refreshes.
